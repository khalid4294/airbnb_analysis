## Motivation
This is my first data science project!

I chose to work on datasets from Airbnb because I was interested to see a breakdown of listiings, their attributes, what effects their prices, and how are diistributed over the cities analyzed in this project.

I also admire how Airbnb published such rich datasets to the public. This is helpful for the data scinece comminty to sharpen their skills with real world data.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to Airbnb for publishing such rich and interesting datasets, here's the [Original Source](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
I got the file from this Kaggle post [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=calendar.csv) - [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data?select=reviews.csv)

Also, thanks to this [Blog Post](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-3-easy-maps-with-python-fb7dfb1036) I learned how to map coordinates in three different map styles.

Finally, I'd like to thank the great team of Udacity, who is supervising this project.
