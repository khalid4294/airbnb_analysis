Thanks to Airbnb for publishing such rich and interesting datasets, here's the [Original Source](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
I got the file from this Kaggle post [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=calendar.csv) - [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data?select=reviews.csv)

Also, thanks to this [Blog Post](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-3-easy-maps-with-python-fb7dfb1036) I learned how to map coordinates in three different map styles.

Finally, I'd like to thank the great team of Udacity, who is supervising this project.
